    This website helps you to select the next game to play. It uses an interactive recommendation engine,
    called ProbQA. In each step the engine lists the top recommendations for you given your answers to previous
    questions. The more questions you answer, the better should be the recommendations. However, if you want to
    try something different, click "Start new quiz". <br/>
    In contrast to the previous search and recommendation engines, ProbQA can suggest the next game to play for a user
    even if the user doesnâ€™t have any clear understanding or keywords to search for, cannot define his/her preferences,
    cannot name similar games, etc.
